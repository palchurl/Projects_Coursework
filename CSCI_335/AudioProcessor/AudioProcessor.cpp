each element is traversed through and if the element is in the range of level and negative 
level a counter is incremented and added into the tempAudio vector. Once we reach 
a element that is not in the range then a possible group has been passed so we chack if 
the counter is at least silence length and if it is elements are poped of until counter 
returns to its original value of 0. This cuts out the group and now we just push the current 
element and reset the counter in case a group hasnt been passed. Now if the current element 
is the last one in the vector we repeat the check to catch any last group that is 
within level and then after every element has been traversed and processed the tempAudio is returned.
